#### Background

My name is Tristen White and I am from Dubuque, Iowa. I'm currently a Junior here at Iowa State :cyclone: (supposed to be a cyclone :laughing:). I wanted to study Aerospace Engineering to have the chance to take part in the exploration of space and other planets :milky_way:. My dream is to be alive when humans are finally able to travel to other planets and possibly colonize them.:seedling: I am also fascinated with different species of animals, so I think it would be really cool to be around when/if we ever find new life on other planets even if they're just multi-cell organisms.

#### What I'd like to learn

I've been hearing more and more about A.I development and how it's advancing pretty fast. I think if we learn about machine learning that it would be one of the more fun/interesting topics we go over in this class. I also like coding in general, so I'm hoping that this class will be enjoyable overall.:computer:
